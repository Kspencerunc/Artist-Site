		<h3>     Artist statement - Last updates were made in Fall of 2020</h3>
		<p>I use images of personal memories, real life events, 
horror films or nightmares, to portray what I consider to be potential visual pleasures or disturbances. 
A number of my personal works have what I consider important stories/aspects of my own life. I want to use these works to instill emotions in the viewer, or to allow viewers visceral reactions to different horror themes.
</p>
<p>Portraying this imagery in a physical spaces is not only somewhat therapeutic in initial processing of certain events – but the imagery allows viewers to confront different fears in a more controlled and distanced environment. I use that distance to convert private negative emotions, and other imagery into a subject I am more comfortable discussing. In other words, the creation of my works allows me to lay myself bare in a sense. </p>
<p>Other works that I am involved in are done in collaboration, or they are direct commission – these works often do not have a horror theme, and are instead meeting requirements given.</p>
<p>For a good example of how I personally sort my works, you will find below that personal works with common themes, and series are placed together. </p>
